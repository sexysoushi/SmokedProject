## particle-system

![00](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karimnaaji/particle-system/master/doc/img/23-waves.png)

This is a project done in Spring 2014 at UTBM. The goal was to use OpenGL 
to develop a system that can generate particles and manage them. This was 
done here with shaders.

To launch the project, simply open it with QtCreator :)
